To create a static website using Next.js, you can follow these general steps:
- Create a new Next.js app:
    You can create a new Next.js app by running the command `npx create-next-app` in your terminal and following the prompts.
- Create your pages:
    In Next.js, each page is represented by a file in the `pages` directory. Create your page files with the necessary content and structure.
- Add navigation:
    Create a navigation menu or links between pages using Next.js's built-in `Link` component or another navigation library.
- Add styles:
    Add styles to your pages using CSS modules, styled-components, or another styling library.
- Build your site:
    To create a static version of your Next.js app, run the command `npm run build`. This will generate an optimized production build of your app.
- Export your site:
    To export your app as a static website, run the command `npm run export`. This will generate a static version of your app in the `out` directory, which you can then deploy to your preferred hosting service.

Here's an example of what your file structure might look like for a simple static Next.js website:

```css
my-next-app/
├── pages/
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── about.js
│   └── contact.js
├── styles/
│   └── global.css
├── components/
│   ├── Header.js
│   └── Footer.js
├── package.json
└── README.md
```
